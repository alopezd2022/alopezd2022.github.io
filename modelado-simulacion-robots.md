Welcome to the Mobile Robotics blog! In this blog, you will find content and solutions to the practices proposed by the Mobile Robotics course. Each practice will include a description, details about it, the hardware used, and finally, the software developed and implemented. Additionally, you will find a video that showcases the final operation and process, detailing errors and possible solutions until reaching the final solution.

The course focuses on solving common problems in autonomous robots using advanced **algorithms and techniques** such as local and global navigation, mapping, self-localization, and **SLAM**. It includes hands-on practice in programming skills for mobile robots (drones, autonomous vehicles, etc.) using tools like **ROS** and **Gazebo**. It also covers swarm robot coordination and the use of advanced sensors. Prior knowledge of programming and robotics-related courses is recommended.
