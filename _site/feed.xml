<p>The goal is to develop a software for a vacuum cleaner robot. The robot must explore the most surface of the house.
For that, we only have the laser sensor and the bumper; therefore the software for this application is not quite difficult.</p>

<p>Remember that the vacuum cleaner cannot make use of localization algorithms.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>As actuators, we have the wheels of the robot, which can move in a linear and angular way.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As sensors, we have a laser LIDAR 180ยบ and a bumper.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="software">Software</h2>
<p>The system must be reactive, so that I have developed a state machine whose behavior is described below.</p>
